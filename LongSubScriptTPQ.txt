1. Which operators are friends and which are members?
 Do any have to be members?

The subscript [] and function object () operators are members. 

Actually the insertion and extraction operators 
are both friends and members of the class. 
This is a new feature that c++ allows.

2. Which operators should be const? 
What other methods might well be const?

The typcast long operator and the subscript [],
 the getter methods as well.

3. Does this class serve any useful purpose? Why/Why not?

I think it's very useful, we can get an individual number from 
a certain number space from a long interger. or we can get a range 
of numbers within the long int. This could be useful when storing 
alots of information in the form of longs and then retrieving it 
as needed (maybe its more effiecient to do this, but at the 
cost of readability). 

4. What use is a typecast operator? When would it be called? 
   Why would you want your objects to be cast back to a simpler type?

The typecast operator is used to convert the returned object value 
from our subscript [] and function object () operator overloads
into longs. It'll be called when the long object is being used with 
other data types, like for example, 

Its to use the long object seamlessly with other long data types,
for example, if j and k are our enchanced long objects, 
we would want to use them in code for practial purposes like this:

long p = k + j + 100 - 5;
